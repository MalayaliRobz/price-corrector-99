Have you ever seen a price tag of $99.99? Why do they price it like that instead of just $100. Turns out it is to trick you brain into thinking that it's price is lower that expected. Don't believe me, check out this video from "brain stuff" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvF4kFPE8U4.
Price corrector extension rounds out the prices for you and shows the rounded price on your screen. So you can take a better decisions while online shopping.
$99.99 becomes $100, $39 becomes $40 and so on.
The rounding can be customised based on your requirements.

If the difference of the price and its next whole number is less than or equal to the difference limit set, addon rounds the price and shows the rounded price on the website.

Install the extension and don't get tricked into the psychological pricing trick.
